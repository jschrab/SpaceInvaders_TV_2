# Space Invaders TV 2
### Eternally Self-Destroying Space Invaders

__Space Invaders TV 2 - Eternally Self-Destroying Space Invaders__ is a simple Arduino-driven NTSC signal generating loop of the three classic Space Invaders going through their 2 frame animation, then their 1 frame "explosion". The pixel maps are from the the original Space Invaders coin-op game. For the most part, it is just a demo of generating NTSC signals via an Arduino and a few resistors.

Currently, the code only seems to work with a ATmega328 enabled Duemilanove. I assume there is a timing issue on the Leonardo that needs to be accounted for.
